## Project Overview

Nowadays, **Decision Trees** represent one of the most popular **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**. They are commonly used in **classification problems**, but yet versatile enough to address **regression tasks** as well. The core concept behind a decision tree resides in **consecutive partitions of data** using feature-based decision-making processes that can be visually represented with a tree structure. This structure consists of nodes and leaves where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node holds a target class label.

These can vary from:

- **ID3 Algortihm**.
- **CART Algorithm**.
- **(C4.5) Algorithm**.

And even used within **ensemble models**:

- **Random Forest** (Use of Multiple Decision Trees to make a decision).
- **AdaBoost** (Use of Stumps as Weak Learners to make a decision).
- **XGBoost** (One of the best decision trees algorithms used in real world applications).

Consequently, due to their usefullness, this **Assignment #2** focuses on implementing one of these Algorithms:
