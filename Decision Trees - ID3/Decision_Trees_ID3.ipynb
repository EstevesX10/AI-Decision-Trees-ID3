    "A well-known decision tree approach for Machine Learning is the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm. By choosing the best characteristic at each node to partition the data depending on information gain, it recursively constructs a tree. The goal is to make the final subsets as homogeneous as possible. By choosing features that offer the greatest reduction in entropy or uncertainty, ID3 iteratively grows the tree. The procedure keeps going until a halting requirement is satisfied, like a minimum subset size or a maximum tree depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ID3 Algorithm is specifically designed for building decision trees from a given dataset. It's primary objective is to construct a tree that best explains the relationship between attributes in the data and their corresponding class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Selecting the Best Attribute:**\n",
    "- ID3 employs the concept of entropy and information gain to determine the attribute that best separates the data. Entropy measures the impurity or randomness in the dataset.\n",
    "- The algorithm calculates the entropy of each attribute and selects the one that results in the most significant information gain when used for splitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Creating Tree Nodes:**\n",
    "- The chosen attribute is used to split the dataset into subsets based on its distinct values.\n",
    "- For each subset, ID3 recurses to find the next best attribute to further partition the data, forming branches and new nodes accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Stopping Criteria:**\n",
    "- The recursion continues until one of the stopping criteria is met, such as when all instances in a branch belong to the same class or when all attributes have been used for splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Handling Missing Values:**\n",
    "- ID3 can handle missing values to prevent overfitting. While not directly included in ID3, post-processing techniques or variations like C4.5 incorporate pruning to improve the tree's generalization."

    "### Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entropy** is a measure of disorder or uncertainty in a set of data. It is a tool used in ID3 to measure a dataset's disorder  or impurity. By dividing the data into as homogeneous subsets as feasible, the objective is to minimze entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a set $S$ with classes $\\{c_1,\\space c_2,\\space ...\\space,\\space c_n \\}$, the entropy is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\space p_i \\space log_2(p_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p_i$ is the proportion of instances of class $c_i$ in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain measures how well a certain quality reduces uncertainty. ID3 splits the data at each stage, choosing the property that maximizes Information Gain. It is computes using the distinction between entropy prior to and following the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain measures the effectiveness of an Attribute $A$ in reducing uncertainty in set $S$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$IG(A,S) = H(S) - \\sum_{v \\space \\in \\space values(A)} \\frac{|S_v|}{|S|} \\cdot H(S_v))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, $|S_v|$ is the size of the subset of $S$ for which attribute $A$ has value $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gain Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Gain Ratio is an improvement on Information Gain that considers the inherent worth of characteristics that have a wide range of possible values. It deals with the bias of Information Gan in favor of characteristics with more pronounced values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ GR(A,S) = \\frac{IG(A,S)}{\\sum_{v \\space \\in \\space values(A)} \\frac{|S_v|}{|S|} \\cdot log_2(\\frac{|S_v|}{|S|})} $$"
